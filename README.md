This is a game of Rock, Paper Scissors.
It is for the enjoyment of all users and is a very simple game to play.

The user selects a button (Rock, Paper or Scissors) and the computer will make a corresponding selection. 
The objective of the game is to select the element that is stronger 
      Rock blunts Scissors, 
      Paper covers Rock, 
      Scissors cuts Paper.


      To my Assessor, I apologise for the state of my submission. I am really struggling with the Javascript module, and having time in general to study. I have also had a few issues at home in the last month which had left me way behind, However I do not want to give up on this course as I am really enjoying it, I am hoping to have more time off later in the year to catch up.
      I am submitting my project only so I can resubmit at a later stage and not be omitted from the class. I am fully aware that it is nowhere near pass criteria. 

      Thank you
      Sharon
