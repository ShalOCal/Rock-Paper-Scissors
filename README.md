This is a game of Rock, paper, scissors. It is a simple and fun game for players of all ages. 
Here we play against the computer to see who can socre the highest.
Rock beats scissors
Paper beats Rock
Scissors beats paper

To my Assessor, 

I apologise for the state of my submission. I am really struggling with the course at the moment and have not had enough time to grasp the fundamentals of javascript
nevermind complete the project. I have 5 children and I also work full time. My husband is a paramedic and is away quite a bit. This is not an excuse merely an explaination
and I am not looking for any sympathy. 
I am submitting my project only so that I can resubmit at a later stage and not be omitted from the course as I am really enjoying it. I am fully aware that it is nowhere
near pass criteria.

Apologies again and I hope to resubmit a much better version of this later in the year.

Sharon
